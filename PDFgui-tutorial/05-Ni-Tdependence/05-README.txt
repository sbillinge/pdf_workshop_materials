Nickel refinement information:

Space group:		Fm-3m
lattice a:		3.524 Angstroms
fractional coordinate:	0.0	0.0	0.0
Uiso:			0.005
Qmax:			22.0 Inv. Angstroms
Qdamp:		0.045
Qbroad:		0.01

Data: Ni X-ray data available for 80K-500K range in 20K steps, collected at X7B beamline of NSLS using PerkinElmer IP detector

GOAL: Familiarize with usage of sequential T-dependence refinement macro and concept of linked (sequential) fits

TASKS:
1) Set up and refine 300K dataset
2) Set up and run refinement sequence for T-dependence
3) Plot refined parameters as a function of T
4) Think of possible issues/limitations of PDFgui in this situation/setup
