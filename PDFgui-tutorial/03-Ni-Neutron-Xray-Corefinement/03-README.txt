Data: Ni 300K X-ray data collected at XPD at NSLS2 using Perkin Elmer image plate detector, and neutron TOF data from NOMAD at SNS

GOAL:		demonstration of corefinement of multiple datasets and potential issues with such approach

TASKS:
1) Set up and execute a corefinement of X-ray and neutron data
2) Review the fit results
3) Think of the reasons why such a corefinement could fail
4) Compare the fits from corefinement with single datasets from previous examples. 
You will observe that one of the dataset in the corefinement is fit poorer than when used alone. Why is that?
