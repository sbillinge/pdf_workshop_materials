Data: Neutron data for LaMnO3 at 300K obtained at NPDF at LANSCE

GOAL: Familiarize with setting up a complex unit cell

TASKS:
1) Set up a refinement of a moderately complex model with Uiso
2) Execute the fit using Uiso
3) Observe results and fit quality
4) Can the fit can be improved by adding more parameters?
5) Attempt to introduce anisotropic U for selected crystallographic sites, and carry out the refinement.
6) Compare the results with these obtained in step 2) above

*You may consider loading the phase from lamno3_pbnm.cif file, and set up your refinements from there
