GOAL: demonstration of doping-dependence sequential refinement setup

TASKS:
1) Set up and refine Bmab model to x=0.00 data
2) Plot final fit and assess refined parameters
3) Use doping-dependence macro to set up doping-dependent fit
NOTE: be careful with composition, x is double of the site occupancy!
4) Inspect the setup to ensure everything looks good
4) Refine the sequence
5) Check the fit quality of all the fits
6) Plot refined parameters vs doping 
7) For selected non-zero doping introduce doping constraint manually
8) Carry out the refinement that includes doping parameter
9) Inspect the fit and check the result
