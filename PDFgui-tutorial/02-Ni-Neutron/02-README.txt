Nickel refinement information:

Space group:		Fm-3m
lattice a:		3.524 Angstroms
fractional coordinate:	0.0	0.0	0.0
Uiso:			0.005
Qmax:			Qmax Inv. Angstroms (different data with different Qmax, PDFgui will read that info if in metadata)
Qdamp:		initially set to 0.02
Qbroad:		initially set to 0.01 

Data: Ni 300K neutron TOF data collected at NPDF at LANSCE (Qmax=27 A**-1), and NOMAD at SNS (Qmax=31.4 A**-1)
Why is Qmax different? How does one choose Qmax?

GOAL: Familiarization with PDFgui. Set up and refine neutron 300K Ni data and determine setup-related parameters 
Qdamp and Qbroad assuming nickel is being used as a "calibrant"

TASKS:
1) Set up and refine 300K neutron dataset of your choice over some sensible r-range, say from 1.5-50 Angstroms
2) Observe the fit result
3) Play with the refinement range and see how this affects refined parameters..
4) Repeat the refinement for the other dataset using the same parameter set and same conditions
5) Observe the fit result
6) Compare results of the two refinements and see what is different. Think why is that so. 
7) Compare the results with those of x-ray nickel PDF in example 01
